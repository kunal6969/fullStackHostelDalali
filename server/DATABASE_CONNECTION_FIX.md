# Database Connection Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Root Cause Found & Fixed

**Problem**: The `.env` file had an incomplete MongoDB connection string that was missing the database name:
```
# WRONG (was connecting to default database):
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&...

# FIXED (now connects to correct database):
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/hostel-dalali?directConnection=true&...
```

## What Happened

1. **Backend was connecting to wrong database** - Default database instead of `hostel-dalali`
2. **Old cached logs showed "4 listings found"** - These were from the wrong database
3. **Frontend getting empty results** - Because `hostel-dalali` database is empty
4. **No error messages** - Connection worked, just wrong database

## Current Status

âœ… **Database connection fixed** - Now connecting to correct `hostel-dalali` database
âœ… **Server restarted** - New connection active
âœ… **Empty database confirmed** - `hostel-dalali` database has 0 listings (expected)

## Next Steps

The frontend should now be able to:
1. **Connect to correct database** - All API calls will use `hostel-dalali` database
2. **Create new listings** - Room creation should work and be visible
3. **See listings** - Once created, listings will appear in search

## Test Plan

1. **Create a test listing** - Use the room creation form
2. **Verify it appears** - Check the search rooms page
3. **Test filtering** - Try different search criteria

The root cause is now fixed - the search page will show listings once they are created in the correct database! ðŸŽ‰
